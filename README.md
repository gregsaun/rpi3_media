# rpi3_media
All config and doc to install a media center on my Raspberry Pi

Here is a list of software and hardware used:
- osmc for movies
- mpd for music (I don't like osmc Android clients)
- IQaudio DAC Pro extension board
- soft shutdown script with external button and power led indicator soldered on GPIO (use interrupt)

Check INSTALL.md for installation steps
